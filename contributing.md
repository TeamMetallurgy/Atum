Welcome to the Atum Contribution file! We'd like to thank you for your interest in assisting us with Atum, your support and assistance is greatly appreciated.

Please take a moment to read over the rules for contributing to make sure you don't have to do extra work later undoing or fixing things.

**Contribution Rules**

* No using formatters on our code. Most programs come with a default formatter so before you begin coding please make sure you don't have that active. We won't accept PRs with formatting and you will have to fix your code. We are formatted to the Minecraft default code and using a formatter can mess with our logs of exact edits and make it hard to pinpoint changes.
* No reorganizing lists or code sections unless strictly necessary. Things are laid out in a very specific way at the moment from old to do and messing with that can make it harder on translators. We will likely do a massive organization project at a later date as an Issue.
* Your commit notes should contain a minor summary of the fix (even if its simply a re-iteration of the issue.)

If you have ***any* questions** feel free to ask. We would prefer you ask **BEFORE** starting rather than after as it saves us both work.

If you'd like to begin you can check our current [Issues page](https://github.com/TeamMetallurgy/Atum/issues) and find something you're interested in taking a shot at. Please pay attention to tags as some things have already been PR'd or fixed by someone else and we'd hate to see your time wasted.

Thanks again for contributing to Atum and we look forward to working with you in the future!
